# Testimonial CPT and Carousel Post type

This plugin, when installed, will programmatically create a custom post type called "testimonials" (but you can change that to whatever you like).

The purpose is to make it easier to install and customize the look and behaviour of a testimonial (or other CPT).

This plugin is built on the classic editor, and styles are done with sass, compiled by Gulp.

To update it, cd into the plugin directory, and run 
`npm install`

Next, run `gulp watchSass`, and it will compile the sass into the testimonial_styles.css plugin at the root of the directory.
